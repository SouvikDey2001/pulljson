		<span class="label label-inverse">In brief</span>
		<div>
		This service is done mainly for mobile/tablet needs in mind to access web data via jsonp, CORS is also supported.
			<br />
		</div>
		<div>
			<ul style="list-style:none">
				<li>If you are just wondering how to access a nice json api via mobile I'd recommend <a href="https://jsonp.nodejitsu.com" target="_blank"><i class="icon-external-link"></i>https://jsonp.nodejitsu.com</a></li>
				<li>If you need full power of (rich) javascript + actual event handling possibilties I'd recommend checking <a href="http://nrabinowitz.github.com/pjscrape/" target="_blank"><i class="icon-external-link"></i>pjscrape</a></li>
				<li>If you need reporting features(scheduled emails and diff reports) I'd recommend <a href="http://femtoo.com" target="_blank"><i class="icon-external-link"></i>femtoo.com</a> which uses cquery.com</li>
			</ul>
		</div>
		<hr />
		<span class="label label-important">Limitations</span>
		<div>
			<ul style="list-style:none">
				<li>There will be hardly any navigation and interaction (read as javascript) support with service in web pages</li>
				<li>This service and site is one developer's hobby project</li>
				<li>Thus, the service and this site might be offline every now and then.</li>
			</ul>
		</div>
		<hr />
		<span class="label label-default">Other services</span>
		<div>
			Certainly there are other tools besides this in the wild which operate similarly
			and have affected also creating this tool by myself with node.js.
			<br /><br />
			
			To name some of those tools are
			<br />
			<table border="1">
				<th>name</th><th>query methods</th><th>online</th>
				<tr><td>anyorigin.com</td><td>none, one big content property</td><td>online</td><tr>
				<tr><td>yahoo pipes</td><td>xpath</td><td>online</td><tr>
				<tr><td>pjscrape (phantomjs)</td><td>jquery</td><td>standalone</td><tr>
				<tr><td>google spreadsheet</td><td>xpath</td><td>online</td><tr>
				<tr><td>cquery.com</td><td>css selectors</td><td>online</td></tr>
			</table>
			<br />
			I'd see this service resembles most closely cquery.
			Yet, anyorigin might seem very similar also at first look but there are differences how 'jquery' is used.
